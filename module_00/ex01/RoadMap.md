Make a Graph class that can place Vector2 objects and display the graph

- [x] Create a contener Vector2
    - [x] two components x and y of type float
    - [x] getters and setters
    - [x] make a compare operator for std::less used by std::map default value for third template parameter
        - [x] "norm" method to get a Vector2 length with the center of the graph as the other point
- [ ] Create a class Graph
    - [ ] attribute size and attribute list of Vector2 for the graph points
    - [ ] can place some Vector2 as points
    - [ ] once every points added into it, you must output it on screen, via an ascii art
- [x] you must be able to explain the decision you made over encapsulation.
- [x] vector2 must contain an attribute representing x and y.
- [ ] user must be allow to add a new Vector2 onto the Graph
- [ ] user must be able to output the content of the graph onto the console in a graph-like form
